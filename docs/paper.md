# Summary

Masked autoregressive flow [@NIPS2017_6c1da886] is a state-of-the-art non-parametric density estimation technique. It is based on the idea of normalizing flows where a simple base probability distribution is mapped into the target distribution, which can have much more structures than the base distribution, via a sequence of bijective transformations.
